overview: >-
  The Garden City Apartments is a 40-unit workforce housing asset acquired in
  2020. At the time of acquisition, rents were significantly below market and
  professional management systems were not in place. The value-add process
  included "mark-to-market" rent increases, the implementation of automated
  and professional management systems, and light unit and common area
  renovations.

investment_thesis: >-
  Strong workforce housing asset located in a stable neighborhood proximate to
  employment centers and transit corridors. Walk-up units offer a single-family
  experience within a full-service apartment community, creating strong rental
  demand. Increasing rents to market rates and reducing operating expenses via
  streamlined property management processes resulted in increased net operating
  income and corresponding asset value.

highlights:
  - Strong location near major employment centers and transit corridors
  - Limited supply of single entry walk-up units supports demand
  - Common area greenspace, accessibility, and on-site parking adjacent to unit entries
