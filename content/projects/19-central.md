overview: >-
  19 Central is strategically positioned between Porter Square and Union
  Square in the Somerville/Cambridge submarket. Prior ownership had held
  the asset since its original development in the 1970s, and the property
  was due for modernization. With strong fundamentals and solid building
  bones, our value-add program focused on comprehensive interior unit
  renovations and common area upgrades to reposition the asset for today’s
  renter while preserving its long-term durability.

investment_thesis: >-
  Well-located multifamily investment in a high-demand, transit-oriented
  submarket, executing a targeted value-add strategy through interior
  renovations, operational enhancements, and disciplined rent growth to
  drive sustainable cash flow and long-term appreciation.

  - 30-unit multifamily property
  - Significant interior and common area renovation program
  - Value creation through unit upgrades and market rent increases
  - Tech-enabled property management implementation
  - Located between Porter and Union Squares in supply-constrained market
