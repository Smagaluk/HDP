overview: >-
  Factory Yards North Commercial is a purpose-built commercial component
  within the broader Factory Yards redevelopment in Grand Rapids.
  The project delivers modern, highly functional space designed to support
  long-term tenant success while complementing the surrounding residential
  and commercial activation of the district. The development reflects our
  focus on durable design, efficient execution, and thoughtful integration
  into a revitalized historic industrial environment.

  ecosystem, the asset is positioned for predictable income and long-term
  appreciation.
