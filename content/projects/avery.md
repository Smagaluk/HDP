overview: >-
  Located in the heart of Detroit's historic Woodbridge neighborhood, Avery
  Place is a 23-unit condominium project that was constructed on previously
  underutilized land purchased from the Detroit Land Bank Authority. This
  infill project was thoughtfully designed to be harmonious with the
  neighborhood's existing historic housing stock. The project includes an
  integrated pocket park, garage parking with electric chargers, walkup unit
  entries, and large balconies. The project also benefits from a Brownfield
  tax recapture as well as the Neighborhood Enterprise Zone (NEZ) exemption
  for homebuyers, significantly reducing the annual property tax expense for
  homeowners.
