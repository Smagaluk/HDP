overview: >-
  Factory Yards South Commercial reimagines a former 67,000-square-foot
  industrial building within the broader Factory Yards redevelopment,
  transforming underutilized manufacturing space into productive,
  tenant-focused commercial uses. The project blends adaptive reuse with
  thoughtful modernization, creating amenity-driven space designed to
  support both residents of the Factory Yards district and the surrounding
  neighborhood while preserving the historic character of the structure.

investment_thesis: >-
  The project unlocks value from otherwise difficult-to-develop industrial
  space by integrating climate-controlled self-storage as a resident
  amenity within the broader Factory Yards district. This approach
  efficiently utilizes non-traditional commercial space while supporting
  the residential ecosystem, generating stable income and enhancing the
  overall livability and long-term performance of the mixed-use community.

highlights:
  - 67,000-square-foot adaptive reuse industrial redevelopment
  - Fitness and lifestyle-oriented commercial tenant opportunities
  - Climate-controlled indoor self-storage component as resident amenity
  - Integrated within the broader Factory Yards mixed-use district
  - Preservation of historic industrial character with modern upgrades
  - Designed to support long-term operational stability and value creation
