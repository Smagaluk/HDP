overview: >-
  The Gateways of Plymouth was acquired out of bankruptcy as a development site
  with horizontal infrastructure in place. Located in the highly desirable
  corridor between downtown Northville and downtown Plymouth, Michigan, the
  investment presented the opportunity to leverage previously completed
  infrastructure to construct for-sale condominiums on an infill site with
  strong market demand. After completion and sale of the first phase, the
  remaining lots were sold to a local homebuilder at a significant risk-adjusted
  profit.

investment_thesis: >-
  Excellent location between two thriving suburban downtown markets with high
  average household incomes; capitalized on then low mortgage interest rates
  driving buyer demand; in-place infrastructure and entitlements presented the
  opportunity to quickly construct product to meet strong market demand for
  residential condominiums in the submarket.

highlights:
  - Excellent suburban downtown-proximate location
  - In place infrastructure and entitlements
  - Strong demand for for-sale residential condominium product
