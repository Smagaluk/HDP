overview: >-
  Acquired as a 55+ apartment community, the Eastpointe Apartments presented
  an opportunity to acquire a well-maintained asset with long-term residents
  with stable monthly incomes. Rents at the time of acquisition were below
  market and professional management systems were not in place. The value-add
  process included increasing market rents, re-tenanting a small number of
  severely delinquent units, and implementing professional property management
  systems as well as opening the pool of potential tenants to include qualified
  tenants outside of the previous 55+ mandate.

investment_thesis: >-
  Strong location; stable in-place tenant base; well located workforce housing
  asset; limited deferred maintenance in conjunction with below market rents
  presents the opportunity for stable cash flow with risk-adjusted upside.

highlights:
  - Strong location
  - Limited deferred maintenance
  - Stable tenant base
