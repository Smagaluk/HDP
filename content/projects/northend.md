overview: >-
  Purchase from the City of Detroit Land Bank Authority (DLBA), the assets in
  this portfolio represented an opportunity to acquire a small multifamily
  portfolio in an emerging neighborhood at an extremely low basis. The project
  consisted of a full renovation of the interior and exterior of each building,
  including all plumbing electrical, and mechanical systems, interior buildout,
  and exterior building elements. The North End neighborhood has experienced
  rapid growth in rental demand and units were rented at rates significantly
  above pro forma.

investment_thesis: >-
  Low acquisition basis; emerging "fringe" location; tax-favorable basis due to
  prior land bank ownership; strong rental demand.

highlights:
  - Adjacent to the newly constructed Q-Line light rail system
  - Proximate to dining, entertainment and employment centers of Midtown and Downtown
  - Low acquisition basis
