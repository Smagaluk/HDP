overview: >-
  The Milwaukee Condominiums project involved the redevelopment of a vacant,
  blighted, and functionally obsolete building located in Detroit's emerging
  Milwaukee Junction neighborhood. Purchased from the Wayne County tax
  foreclosure auction, the building was completely rehabilitated into 8
  for-sale condominium units as well as two ground floor commercial spaces.
  Home to the award winning Kiesling Bar and Milwaukee Caffe coffee shop, the
  activation of this space was a catalyst for additional neighborhood
  development, with Milwaukee Junction now home to many diverse and thriving
  businesses, including a Michelin Star rated restaurant.

investment_thesis: >-
  Low acquisition basis; emerging "fringe" location; value creation through
  thoughtful placemaking.

highlights:
  - Emerging location proximate to major employment and higher education centers
  - Covered garage parking
  - Historic adaptive re-use
